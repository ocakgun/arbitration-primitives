# Asynchronous Arbitration Primitives for New Generation of Circuits and Systems

This paper presents an overview of a family of asynchronous arbitration
primitives designed to increase the resilience and efficiency of
the new generation of circuits and systems. We cover primitives for
interfacing analog and digital worlds, sampling of non-persistent
signals, and efficient handling of correlated sensor events.
