## Abstract

This paper presents an overview of a family of asynchronous arbitration primitives designed
to increase the resilience and efficiency of the new generation of circuits and systems.
We cover primitives for synchronisation and decision-making with an emphasis on interfacing
analogue and digital worlds, sampling of non-persistent signals, and efficient handling of
correlated sensor events.
